# Gulp test

This repository is a very small experiment suite for Gulp.

It serves a mock blogpost which contains an excerpt of The Lord of the Rings (mainly the passage about the Mines of Moria, because I was watching the movie while building this suite).

You can start up a small local webserver and navigate to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000):
````bash
gulp serve
````

To build the Sass code, you can run:
````bash
gulp sass
````
